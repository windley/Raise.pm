This is a sample Perl module for creating Kinetic Event Architecture endpoints. 

The module supports both the Blue and Sky versions of EXP (http://developer.kynetx.com/display/docs/Sky+Event+API)

See demo.pl for an example of using it with Blue.

See demo_sky.pl for an example of using it with Sky. 

This library works in conjunction with [KRLRulesets/echo](https://github.com/KRLRulesets/echo). 

See the [description of the echo server and its functionality](http://developer.kynetx.com/display/docs/Creating+an+Echo+Server) for a sample of how this is used.
